# üèóÔ∏è Bedrock Agents Console Setup Guide

This guide shows you how to recreate your market research agents using Amazon Bedrock Agents (managed service) through the AWS console.

## üéØ What We'll Create

**3 Bedrock Agents** that mirror your programmatic agents:
1. **Market Research Agent** - Market analysis and opportunities
2. **Risk Assessment Agent** - Risk evaluation and scoring  
3. **Market Entry Advisor** - Combined recommendations (orchestrator equivalent)

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required AWS Permissions
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "bedrock:*",
                "iam:CreateRole",
                "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
                "iam:PassRole",
                "lambda:CreateFunction",
                "lambda:InvokeFunction",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Setup Steps
1. ‚úÖ **AWS Account** with Bedrock access
2. ‚úÖ **Model Access** - Enable Claude 3 models in Bedrock console
3. ‚úÖ **S3 Bucket** - For knowledge base documents (optional)
4. ‚úÖ **IAM Roles** - Will be created during setup

   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       # Extract parameters
       country = event.get('country', 'Germany')
       industry = event.get('industry', 'technology')
       
       # Mock market data (replace with real API calls)
       market_data = {
           "market_size_usd": "180 billion",
           "growth_rate": "4.2%",
           "top_competitors": ["SAP", "Siemens", "Deutsche Telekom"],
           "regulatory_complexity": "High",
           "market_maturity": "Mature"
       }
       
       return {
           'statusCode': 200,
           'body': json.dumps({
               'country': country,
               'industry': industry,
               'data': market_data
           })
       }
   ```

7. **API Schema** for the action:
   ```json
   {

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Agent 2: Risk Assessment Agent

### Create the Agent

1. **Create New Agent:**
   ```
   Agent Name: RiskAssessmentAgent
   Description: Evaluates market entry risks across multiple categories
   ```

2. **Foundation Model:**
   ```
   Model: Claude 3 Haiku (faster for risk calculations)
   ```

3. **Agent Instructions:**
   ```
   You are a risk assessment specialist focused on international market entry risks.

   Analyze these risk categories with scores (1-10 scale, 10 = highest risk):

   1. POLITICAL RISK - Government stability, policy changes, political tensions
   2. ECONOMIC RISK - Currency volatility, inflation, market conditions  
   3. LEGAL/REGULATORY RISK - Compliance requirements, legal system reliability
   4. OPERATIONAL RISK - Infrastructure, talent availability, supply chain
   5. MARKET RISK - Competition intensity, market dynamics, saturation
   6. TECHNOLOGY RISK - Digital infrastructure, cybersecurity, tech adoption

   For each category provide:
   - Risk score (1-10)
   - 2-3 specific risk factors
   - 1-2 mitigation strategies

   Always conclude with:
   - Overall weighted risk score
   - Risk level (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
   - Market entry recommendation (Go/Caution/Stop)

   Be analytical, data-driven, and provide specific actionable insights.
   ```

### Add Risk Calculation Action

4. **Create Lambda for Risk Scoring:**
   ```python
   import json
   import random

   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       country = event.get('country', 'Germany')
       industry = event.get('industry', 'technology')
       
       # Risk scoring logic (replace with real data sources)
       risk_factors = {
           'political': random.uniform(2, 8),
           'economic': random.uniform(2, 7), 
           'legal': random.uniform(3, 9),
           'operational': random.uniform(2, 6),
           'market': random.uniform(3, 8),
           'technology': random.uniform(2, 5)
       }
       
       overall_score = sum(risk_factors.values()) / len(risk_factors)
       
       if overall_score <= 3:
           risk_level = "Low"
       elif overall_score <= 6:
           risk_level = "Medium"
       elif overall_score <= 8:
           risk_level = "High"
       else:
           risk_level = "Critical"
       
       return {
           'statusCode': 200,
           'body': json.dumps({
               'country': country,
               'industry': industry,
               'risk_scores': risk_factors,
               'overall_score': overall_score,
               'risk_level': risk_level
           })
       }
   ```

   ```python
   import json
   import boto3

   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       bedrock_agent = boto3.client('bedrock-agent-runtime')
       
       # Call Market Research Agent
       response = bedrock_agent.invoke_agent(
           agentId='MARKET_RESEARCH_AGENT_ID',
           agentAliasId='TSTALIASID',
           sessionId=event.get('sessionId', 'default'),
           inputText=f"Analyze the {event.get('industry')} market in {event.get('country')}"
       )
       
       return {
           'statusCode': 200,
           'body': json.dumps({
               'market_analysis': response['completion']
           })
       }
   ```

   **Action Group 2: Risk Assessment**
   ```python
   import json
   import boto3

   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       bedrock_agent = boto3.client('bedrock-agent-runtime')
       
       # Call Risk Assessment Agent
       response = bedrock_agent.invoke_agent(
           agentId='RISK_ASSESSMENT_AGENT_ID',
           agentAliasId='TSTALIASID', 
           sessionId=event.get('sessionId', 'default'),
           inputText=f"Assess risks for {event.get('industry')} market entry in {event.get('country')}"
       )
       
       return {
           'statusCode': 200,
           'body': json.dumps({
               'risk_analysis': response['completion']
           })
       }
   ```

## üìö Optional: Knowledge Base Setup

### Create Knowledge Base for Market Data

1. **Prepare Documents** (upload to S3):
   ```
   s3://your-bucket/market-data/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ germany-market-report.pdf
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ japan-economic-overview.pdf
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uk-regulatory-guide.pdf
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ global-industry-trends.pdf
   ```

2. **Create Knowledge Base:**
   ```
   Knowledge Base Name: MarketResearchKB
   Description: Market research reports and economic data
   Data Source: S3 bucket with your documents
   Embedding Model: Titan Embeddings G1 - Text
   ```

3. **Associate with Agents:**
   - Link to Market Research Agent
   - Link to Market Entry Advisor

---

## üß™ Testing Your Bedrock Agents

### Test Individual Agents

1. **Market Research Agent Test:**
   ```
   Query: "Analyze the fintech market opportunity in Germany"
   Expected: Detailed market analysis with size, competitors, regulations
   ```

2. **Risk Assessment Agent Test:**
   ```
   Query: "What are the risks of entering the Japanese e-commerce market?"
   Expected: Risk scores by category with mitigation strategies
   ```

3. **Market Entry Advisor Test:**
   ```
   Query: "Should my company expand to the UK technology market?"
   Expected: Comprehensive recommendation with market + risk analysis
   ```

### Test Conversations

**Example Chat Flow:**
```
User: "I'm considering expanding my fintech startup to Germany. What do you recommend?"

Agent: [Calls market research and risk assessment, then provides comprehensive recommendation]

User: "What about Japan instead?"

Agent: [Remembers context, compares Germany vs Japan, provides updated recommendation]
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### Best Practices
1. **Start Simple** - Create basic agents first, add complexity later
2. **Test Thoroughly** - Use the test console extensively before production
3. **Monitor Usage** - Set up CloudWatch metrics for agent performance
4. **Version Control** - Use aliases for different versions (dev/staging/prod)
5. **Security** - Implement proper IAM policies and resource-based policies

### Common Issues
- **Model Access** - Ensure all required models are enabled
- **IAM Permissions** - Agent execution roles need proper permissions
- **Lambda Timeouts** - Set appropriate timeout values for action groups
- **Knowledge Base Sync** - Allow time for document indexing

### Cost Optimization
- Use **Claude 3 Haiku** for simple tasks (cheaper)
- Use **Claude 3 Sonnet** for complex analysis
- Implement **session management** to reduce redundant calls
- Monitor **token usage** and optimize prompts
