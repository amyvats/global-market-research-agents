## 🎯 **Quick Start Guide**

### **Prerequisites**
- AWS Account with Bedrock access
- SageMaker notebook instance
- Claude 3 model permissions

### **30-Minute Setup**

1. **Start with Setup** (`01_bedrock_setup_and_testing.ipynb`)
   ```python
   # Initialize Bedrock connection
   import boto3
   bedrock_client = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime', region_name='us-east-1')
   ```

2. **Build Market Agent** (`02_market_research_agent.ipynb`)
   ```python
   # Create market research agent
   agent = MarketResearchAgent()
   result = agent.analyze_market("Germany", "fintech")
   ```

3. **Add Risk Assessment** (`03_risk_assessment_agent.ipynb`)
   ```python
   # Create risk assessment agent
   risk_agent = RiskAssessmentAgent()
   risk_result = risk_agent.comprehensive_risk_assessment("Rwanda", "fintech")
   ```

4. **Enable Multi-Agent** (`04_multi_agent_orchestration.ipynb`)
   ```python
   # Orchestrate multiple agents
   orchestrator = MultiAgentOrchestrator()
   comprehensive_result = orchestrator.comprehensive_market_entry_analysis("Estonia", "technology")
   ```

5. **Test Everything** (`06_agent_testing_guide.ipynb`)
   ```python
   # Run comprehensive tests
   test_all_agents()
   benchmark_global_countries()
   ```

6. **Use Chatbot** (`07_chatbot_interface.ipynb`)
   ```python
   # Interactive chatbot
   chatbot = MarketResearchChatbot()
   response = chatbot.handle_query("Should I invest in Estonian fintech?")
   ```
